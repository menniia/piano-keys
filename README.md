# Piano Keys

## Project Overview

**Piano Keys** is a [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com) project that is an interactive web application designed to help beginner piano students practice their skills. This project uses JavaScript and DOM events to create a piano interface where users can press keys to play notes and follow along with a guided song.

The application features an interactive piano where each key changes color when pressed, and a series of buttons to guide users through the song "Happy Birthday." As users click through the buttons, the lyrics and musical notes update to help them follow along.

## Features

- **Interactive Piano Keys**: Piano keys change color when pressed and revert to their default color when released.
- **Song Progression**: Progress through the song "Happy Birthday" with buttons to update lyrics and musical notes.
- **Dynamic UI Changes**: Show and hide various buttons to control the song's flow and reset the song to the beginning.
